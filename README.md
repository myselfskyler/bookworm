### **Bookworm - Your Ultimate Reading Companion**  

Bookworm is a college project designed to enhance your reading experience. Right now, it's in its early stages, but in the future, we aim to make it more user-friendly, efficient, and a part of your daily routine. Our goal is to create a platform that not only fuels your love for books but also boosts your productivity and knowledge.  

This website is completely built using various AI tools, but it still took a lot of time to develop. In the future, making it fully functional and user-friendly will require even more effort. If you want to contribute and be a part of this journey, please don't hesitate to connect with me online.
